1. Install packages in the frontned and backend folder:
npm install 

2. Start the Backend Application (Node.js)
Once the database and packages are set up, start the backend application by running the following command in your backend folder:
bash
Copy code
node server.js
Or if you're using a framework like Express, the entry point might be different, such as app.js or index.js.

You should now have your backend running, usually at a URL like http://localhost:5000 or another port specified in your application.

3. Start the Frontend Application (React.js)
Now, go to your frontend folder and start the React development server:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
This will run the React app, typically accessible at http://localhost:3000.

4. Test the Application
Visit the frontend app at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
Ensure that your frontend is making API calls to the backend and displaying data correctly.
You can use tools like Postman or your browser's developer tools to check if the API requests from the frontend are being handled properly by the backend.
